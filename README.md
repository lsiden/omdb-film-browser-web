Search and view titles from the [OMDB](https://omdb.org) database.

## Background

I created this simple film browser web app
in order to have a React web project
that I could then learn how to migrate to other platforms
such as [Electron](https://electronjs.org)
and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
and upgraded to run on electron using the instructions in
(this article)[https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-an-electron-application-with-create-react-app-97945861647c].

See [README-create-react-app](README-create-react-app.md) for more info.

### TODO

* A pager. Currently, the query returns only the first 10 films it finds in the database.
